    <h2>Self Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome! Hello, I'm Eric, currently a third year student studying at 
        Northeastern University under Khoury College of Computer Sciences. 
        I am pursuing a Bachelors in Data Science and Business Administration 
        with a concentration in Fintech. I grew up in Quincy, Massachusetts, 
        which is about a thirty minute drive south from the university. Some of 
        my hobbies include listening to music, playing video games, sleeping, and 
        exploring mother nature. My goal after I graduate is to hopefully find a job
        that aligns with my interests and live a stable life.
